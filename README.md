# xbox kernel test suite
Xbox kernel APIs tester written using the opensoure nxdk

This is a tool for testing xbox kernel apis, written to test CxBx-Reloaded kernel implementation.

THIS IS EXTREMELY WIP AND SHOULD NOT BE USED NOW. THE SOURCE CODE WILL BE REORGANIZED SOON.

# TODO:
* Add configuration file support
* Fix the "print" wrapper function to display output on real Xbox
* Reorganize source code (with folders etc)
* Complete the test suite with all xbox kernel APIs

ANY HELP IS REALLY WELCOME!
